What is security?
	Data protection
	Correctness
	Immunity to tampering
	A provisional defintion
		Computer security studies how systems behave in the presence of an *adversary*.
	Insecuirty:
		Level-0 : actual malicious attempt to cause harm
		Level-1: specific errors that could be exploited in an assault
		Level-2: Factors that predispose systems to vulnerability


The Security mindset
	Attacker Mindset
		Look for weakest links
		Identify assumptions of the security system -- and figure out which are false
		Think outside the box -- not constrained by system designer's worldview
	Defender Mindset
]			Want to maintain a level of "rational paranoia"
		Security Policy
			What are we trying to protect?
			What properties do we want to enforce?
		Threat model
			Who are adversaries? Capabilities and motivations?
			What kinds of attack do we care to prevent?
		Risk Assessment
			What are the weaknesses of the system?
			What will successful attacks cost us?
			How likely?
		Countermeasures
			Cost v. benefit
			Technical v. nontechnical
	Security Policies
		What are the assets we want to protect?
	Focusing defense:
		Trusted components: parts that must function correctly for the system to be secure
		Attack surface: parts of the system exposed to the attacker
	Pitfalls
		Convincing oneself of security
			focus on weaknesses and correcting them instead
	Other principles
