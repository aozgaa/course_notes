TYPE CHECKING

----------------------------------------------

A types is
-- a set of values
-- a set of operations on those values

eg: int is -2^31 to 2^31 and an operation is addition.

Static type-checking. Analyze the program at compile time.
Dynamic type-checking. Analyze the program at run time.

Strong type systems prevent all type errors.
Weak type systems allow type errors at runtime.

Note, C/C++ are weakly typed! eg:
printf() accept variable-length arguments
