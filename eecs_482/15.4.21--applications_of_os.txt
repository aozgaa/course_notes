Applications Beyond Operating Systems:

Abstractions:
-- experience with handling permissions
-- mapping between abstractions
-- designing good abstractions for the layer above and below
-- consistency and concurrency
-- scheduling shows up everywhere
-- Caching is an important means for providing locality
-- using indirection make a problem tractable but slow. Then using caching.
-- ordering and atomicity of transactions is fundamental.
-- fault tolerance is important for internet-scale/distributed systems.
-- programming slowly is important
-- collaboration as a skill
