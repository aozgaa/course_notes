Resident and Non-resident Pages:

Effects of page size:
Each page needs extra bits to track whether the page is resident, valid, etc.
Let's estimate the amount of overhead to ~4 bytes.
So a page size of 4 bytes yields a 100% overhead.

If the page is large, then we may over-allocate memory for a program.

Page size is chosen by the hardware.

Benefits of paging:
	Don't need to allocate the entire virtual address space when the program starts.
	the "big void" is unallocated when the program starts.
